# Horiseon site refactor

## Description

This is a website that I have refactored to be more accessible and condensed. I have added semantic HTML elements, as well as ALT image descriptions to make the site more readable for accessibile people as well as more readable for browsers. On top of this I have added comments to both the HTML and CSS code to clean up the look and readability. Structure changes were made in both HTML and CSS code so that the code has better logical flow.

## Installation

There are no steps to installing this website all the functionality is located at:
